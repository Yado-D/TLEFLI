  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/agreement/
    - assets/images/partners/
    - assets/images/social_medias/
    - assets/images/categories/
    - assets/icons/
    - assets/icons/flat_icons/
    - assets/icons/normals/
    - assets/logos/
    - assets/Language/
    - assets/logos/tlefli_app.png


  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: 'Helvetica Neue LT Pro 25 Ultra Light'
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/thin_fonts.otf
          # - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
          # style: italic
    - family: Quicksand
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/light.ttf
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/to/font-from-package
